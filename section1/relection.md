## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
   - Super Learners Read A Lot - “reading is to your mind what exercise is to the body”. If I get stuck, it may help to read actual words about it rather than just code. In other words, I can try to learn things in different capacities.
   - Super Learns View Learning as a Process - “learning is a journey, not a destination.” I think it’s very important to not get caught up in getting something wrong but to focus on learning from the mistake and improving for next time.
   - Super Learners Adopt a Growth Mindset - I need to focus on my goals and end goals. What do I hope to accomplish? This will help me see and be open to opportunities.
   - Super Learners Teach Others - “learners retain 90% of what they learn when they explain the concept to someone else”. I want to speak up in the group and be a leader. I will strive to be the one that understands and helps others.
   - Super learners Take Care of their Brains - DIET! Blueberries, veggies, whole grains, and unsaturated fats. I want to take time for self care and time on Sundays to meal prep for the week.
   - Super Learners Take Short Breaks, Early and Often - “downtime is crucial to retaining”. I need to take advantage of the break times and get up to walk around and shut my brain off for 5 minutes. This will improve what I actually retain.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
   - The data types I learned about were numbers, strings, and booleans. Numbers are numerical values and can be decimals (floating point) or negative numbers. Strings are surrounded by quotes and are similar to sentences. Booleans answer things like yes/no, on/off, true/false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
   - console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
   - // or /* */ The purpose of a code comment is to provide deeper explanations for other developers reading our code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
   - A variable is essentially a value that can change. I would explain this to a child by saying a variable is similar to a container that holds Cheerios. You can open the box to take some of the Cheerios out or add more Cheerios in. You can add other cereals such as Fruit Loops and Rice Krispies. In this case, our variable would be named cerealContainer and one of the values would be Cheerios.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
   - Instagram login page. Three variables would be name, email, and password. I believe all 3 would be strings, but the button you press would be a Boolean to figure out if the email and password were entered correctly.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
   - Concatenation joins two values together. It is a shortcut to reference a variable's value and add it to a string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
   - For Instagram, maybe they use concatenation when you log in and it says Hello, @geenajackson! In this, they would join the string "hello" and add the value of the user's Instagram handle.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
   - I was having trouble thinking of sites that I use and their variables... Can a variable have more than one value? I assume that would be an array (?). Like when I thought of Instagram's homepage, it has multiple photos, stories, DM's, etc. Home page seems way too broad, but it does act like a "container". I got confused here.
