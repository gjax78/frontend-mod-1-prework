## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  - A couple things that resonated with me were “believing I can improve with practice” and “Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). The article mentioned that growth-mindset individuals may be more prone to practice more and persevere. This will be important to remember because as I start a new thing, it is fun and exciting. However, it will soon get harder and harder so it’s important to keep your focus no matter how hard it gets. The ZPD was something new for me. This is basically knowing that you will be pushed a little harder than you’re used to, in order to learn something new. However, the more experience you gain, the more proficient you will be. You can continue to learn more and push harder.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  - One way that I currently demonstrate a growth mindset is simply by taking the leap and keeping my goals in mind. I realize that it will get tough, but I need to continue to push myself. I am not afraid to ask for help, and I will bring this with me through the program. One thing that I could improve on is seeking out challenges. I often tell myself my limit, but I am able to push past that and surprise myself.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  - I would think the "contacts" in our phones would use arrays because they are orderly listed names in a list.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  - Array methods are shortcut ways to modify the array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  - The purpose of a loop is to have the computer print out something multiple times without having to do it manually. They perform repeated tasks. We would use a loop in conjunction with an array to access each individual element and repeat the task based on the condition for that specific element. We would use loops without arrays for a more streamlined, basic way to repeat a generalized task.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  - I would explain it by saying "You know how after you're done playing, you need to put your blocks away? it would be like having a robot friend thats job is to put the blocks away for you. Every time, he picks up the block from the ground and puts it back in the bin and then repeats that until all the blocks are put away."

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  - I noticed after spending about 10 minutes trying to skip a specific element in an array, you can only skip one at a time using "contine." Is this correct? That would seem impossible if I had an array longer than about 10 items and I'd have to make if/else statments for every element I want to skip.
