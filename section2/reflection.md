## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
 - I love how these articles tell you to embrace your dumb questions. They weren’t saying you won’t have any dumb questions (because you will), but they were saying to realize that you do, ask the question, and move on. There’s no point going down the rabbit hole for hours and solving nothing just to prove that you’re not dumb. Another awesome point was learning how to ask questions. It’s one thing to just blurt out your question because the person happens to be in front of you, but it’s another to truly understand what you’re asking and articulate what you’re hoping to achieve.
 - I feel like I haven’t been one to  back away from asking questions, but that might change with a whole new direction and starting from scratch. Also, in my professional life, often times I’m told to keep my head down and I think overtime that wears on you. I hope to break down my barriers of “what I know” and come with a clean slate. I will also want to learn to ask questions sooner than I normally do, as I often wait too long.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
 - I felt okay without the node direction. At first, I got an error message because I was one file too deep. I was able to read the error message and correct it on my own. It got uncomfortable when I started getting into adding numbers via functions because I didn't understand the directions too well... Things are often worded differently across different resources, but mean the same things. I think overtime, this will get easier. It supported my learning by trying to do it on my own first. There were multiple times I wanted to ask a question in Slack but tried googling first and was able to find an answer. It is uncomfortable not knowing if the answer or code is correct.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
 - A conditional statement helps the code make a decision about what to do next. We can accomplish this with 'if' statements. In my daily life, a conditional would be "if my cat is hungry, she will meow." On Instagram, a conditional is most likely used when you type your password into the site. If you type it correctly, it will bring you to your home screen.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
 - To add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, you use the logical operator: &&. Similar to the exercise, we can determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats by typing:
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats); This would print: true. True means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”. False means “no”, “wrong” or “not the truth”. The computer reads true when both of the conditions are true, and false in all other cases.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
 - If you want to check if TWO conditions are met, you can use the && logical operator. If you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, you can use the || (or) logical operator.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
 - I'm still a little confused on the last else line - if the user types anything other than what's declared, then the else line prints? Why can't we use integers and strings interchangeable here?
